       <h2>Projects</h2>
       <p>
         I love being in a business school because it allows me to learn a lot of things, the courses are very diverse and I feel it's a <strong>good fit</strong> for me because i don't exactly know what i want to do. However, I am ambitious and I want to create a good future for myself. I want to have my own company, be able to work from anywhere in the world and have a good work/life balance.
         As you can see, according to my criteria, i think that studing business is a good fit for me.

      <h2>Passion</h2>
       <p>
         I <strong>LOVE</strong> going on adventures and meet new people. It's always so much fun to travel and to learn so much from others. I love sharing and i adore to socialize with others no matter the culture. I had the chance to visit many places around the world. My favorite place in the world is Wilmington, North Carolina, USA. I  love it because it's a beach town. I also love the Cayman Islands but i would not live there.
